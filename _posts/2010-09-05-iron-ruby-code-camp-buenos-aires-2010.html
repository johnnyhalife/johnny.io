<p>Hey folks, yesterday (Sept 3. 2010), I gave a talk on the<a href="http://codecamp.com.ar/"> Code Camp Buenos Aires 2010</a> as the title of this post states I spent some time talking about IronRuby. <strong>The primary focus of the talk was on showing how to get the better of both worlds and how to  work combining them (C# / Ruby).</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://files.me.com/johnny.halife/mqstdf" alt="" /></div>
<p>As I would expect people that attended the talk were senior geeks which engaged with the topic and (hopefully) enjoyed a from-scratch writing of a Testing Framework =).</p>
<p><strong>I want to thank everyone that assisted and <a href="http://twitter.com/msaez">Miguel Saez </a>for the organization of the Event which as usual was flawless.</strong></p>

<p>As promised here are the materials from the talk:</p>
