<p>On July 25th <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch">Dr. Randy Pausch PhD</a>, lost the fight against the Pancreatic Cancer. The brilliant mind behind &quot;The Last Lecture&quot; was 47 years old. Before leaving Randy left an amazing legacy on the &quot;Last Lecture&quot;.</p>  <p>The &quot;<a href="http://www.thelastlecture.com/">Last Lecture</a>&quot; has even more hits than the all time famous &quot;Stay foolish, stay young&quot; talk given by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">Steve Jobs at Stanford university</a>. The talk is about achieving your childhood dreams, about how to live your life in order to always have fun.</p>  <p>The talk began with &quot;What would you say if you knew you were going to die and had a chance to sum up everything that was most important to you?&quot; and after that all his wisdom got revealed.</p>  <p>I knew his lecture since it was recommended on the <a href="www.wired.com">Wired magazine</a> that I love, those sitting around saw me almost crying while I was watching it. It's a lesson learnt by one of the most gifted people I ever seen.</p>  <p>Besides all the fashion and post-mortem merchandising that will appear now that he is gone, I sincerely recommend you to go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube.com</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">watch the video</a>.&#160; Also the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Univesity</a> set up a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/beyond/2008/summer/an-enduring-legacy.shtml">memorial page</a> for Dr. Pausch and a great article about <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2008/July/july25_pausch.shtml">his legacy</a>.</p>  <p>I've shared it couple of months ago on our internal distribution lists, but now I'm doing it publicly so everyone can learn something from one of the greatest minds of the 21st Century.</p>  <p>thanks,   <br /><a href="http://technorati.com/claim/8er7twerrf" rel="me">~johnny</a></p>
