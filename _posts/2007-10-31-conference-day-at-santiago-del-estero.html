<p>Hi Everybody, after the <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/johnny/archive/2007/10/28/Memories-from-Code-Camp-_2D00_-Buenos-Aires-2007.aspx">Code Camp @ Buenos Aires</a>, I've packaged my stuff and came to Santiago del Estero. Here the Santiago del Estero National University (UNSE) is holding a technology conference for 3 days (29, 30, and 31 of October). This conference is called <strong>JUITECE </strong>(Jornadas Universitarias de Inform&#225;tica, Tecnologia, Electronica y Ciencias de la Educaci&#243;n).</p>  <p>I started my day at the Buenos Aires airport where I spent 3 hours more than expected since my flight was delayed. At 12:30pm I flew to Santiago del Estereo and I've arrived at 2:30pm. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1806025243/"><img alt="DSC02260" src="http://static.flickr.com/2018/1806025243_d0da386cca.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Once I was completed settled, I went to the university where I was anxious to see the conference about Virtualization my friend, <a href="http://mariomontalvetti.com.ar/blog">Mario Montalvetti</a>, was presenting. The conference was great, he started from the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization">Virtualization</a> and then moved across all the types of virtualization that exist and also the upcoming products (like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/softgrid/default.mspx">Microsoft Softgrid</a>).</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1806025413/"><img alt="DSC02240" src="http://static.flickr.com/2271/1806025413_50bf497ec9.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>After Mario's track, it was time for me to present <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/">Microsoft PopFly.</a> The conference went very good, I started describing the Web 2.0 Ecosystem and then the mashups that you can create using Microsoft PopFly.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1804178920/"><img alt="PopFly" src="http://static.flickr.com/2310/1804178920_e520d83d62.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Also this journey was another great opportunity to spend some time with those guys passionate about technology and help them on User Groups creation. I'm very happy with the commitment, and passion these people have on their personal/group development.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1806025859/"><img alt="DSC02264" src="http://static.flickr.com/2316/1806025859_c9dd659f44.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>After visiting the university I had time to sightsee Santiago del Estero city which is getting nicer day by day. I took some pictures, and have a cool dinner with the people here. We had problem, an unexpected storm left the city without lights for a while and the streets underwater. I almost had to swim to back get to the hotel.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1806025625/"><img alt="DSC03428" src="http://static.flickr.com/2394/1806025625_03701c2a77.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Now it's time to go back, I'm preparing my stuff to fly back to Buenos Aires. My plane is leaving in a couple of hours. Hope to come back soon.</p>  <p>Thanks,   <br />~johnny</p>
