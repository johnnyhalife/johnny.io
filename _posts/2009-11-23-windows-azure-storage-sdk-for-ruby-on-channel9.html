<p>Since, the first release of the <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/2009/10/16/announcing-ruby-windows-azure-storage-sdk-v05/">Windows Azure Storage SDK for Rub</a>y, I've received retweets and comments from<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jccim/"> Jean-Christophe Cimetiere</a> (Sr. Technical Evangelist - Interop Strategy Team at Microsoft), we never met in person until <a href="http://eglinsky.spaces.live.com/">Ezequiel Glinsky</a> put us in contact.</p>

<p>I traveled to PDC 09' to <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/2009/11/19/pdc-09-tales-from-the-trenches/">work on the Keynote and stuff for the event</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jccim">JC</a>, I was able<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/jccim/Using-Windows-Azure-storage-from-Ruby/"> to record a short demo/interview with him for Channel9</a>. The interview is for those that doesn't know the work we have been doing and also to get you and idea of where this work is going to.</p>

<p>The SDK stills in beta, and we've already implemented a couple of features of the<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd894041.aspx"> 2009-09-19 version of the API</a> announced by <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com">Ray Ozzie on the Microsoft PDC 09'</a>. I hope you like it and any comments will be always welcomed.</p>

<p>As usual thanks to my team: <a href="http://twitter.com/jpgd">Juan Pablo Garcia</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ezequielm">Ezequiel Morito</a> major advisors and contributors of this project.</p>

thanks,
