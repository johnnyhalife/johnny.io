<p>Everyday of my life I carry with me the <em>light-blue</em> bag depicted below. I guessed if I really knew what was in-there. I opened it, took a picture and made a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/451615645/">collage</a> on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. It&#39;s a cool feature of Flickr. Enter and read the notes, and why not share yours!</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/451615645/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="What&#39;s in my bag?" border="0" height="357" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/451615645_62d8916393.jpg" width="478" /></a> </p><p><br />That&#39;s a little bit more about:me :)</p><p>thanks,<br />~johnny</p>
