<p>Late October 2010, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/tosborn">Tim</a>, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/gcox">Geoff</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/johnnyhalife">I</a> went to meet Sam (SR DEV LED from Windows Manageability) to talk about a potential engagement on a Web UI Project for Windows Powershell 3.0. We got really excited about the opportunity and after eleven (11) weeks of hard work, <strong>we helped Windows Manageability to deliver the first version of Windows Powershell Web Access</strong>.</p> <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image.png"><img style="border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 0px;padding-left: 0px;border-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image_thumb.png" width="714" height="364"></a></p> <p><br>Imagine how hard has it been for me to keep the secret during all this time, however today (September 15, 2011) I got really excited when I saw that Windows Powershell Web Access is now public and available for you to use. I'm happier than ever, as it's a huge milestone for me in my professional career being the Architect for the UX of a Windows Product. It's really hard for me to express the satisfaction of all this becoming real.<br><br><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image1.png"><img style="border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 0px;padding-left: 0px;border-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image_thumb1.png" width="644" height="453"></a><br></p> <p>I love Powershell, since the early days of <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/2007/02/01/ship-happens-dinnernownet-is-out-spread-the-word/">DinnerNow</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/jamescon">James Conard</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/thedavidaiken">David Aiken</a>, we have always been advocates of Windows Powershell, you can also see it on all the other projects we helped on the past that they have Powershell somewhere for sure. With this new feature we helped Windows Team on broadening the experience for new users, users on any platform, users anywhere, all it takes is a Web Browser, that can even be a Mobile Device.<br></p> <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image2.png"><img style="border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px;border-bottom: 0px;padding-top: 0px;padding-left: 0px;border-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2011/09/image_thumb2.png" width="741" height="499"></a></p> <p>I will not get on the details as <a href="http://blog.powershell.no/2011/09/14/windows-powershell-web-access/">Jan Egil Ring from blog.powershell.no has a great post on how to enable</a> and play with the feature itself, I just wanted to share my happiness with everybody and also I want to thank the whole team for this awesome delivery, these are the guys that have been involved on the project: <a href="http://twitter.com/jpgd">Juan Pablo Garcia</a> the best HTML/CSS Ninja who can make you think youâ€™re on the real console, Esteban Lopez our Test Jedi who trapped all the bugs (before you hopefully), and Pablo Marc the warrior of the JavaScript Performance who incredibly increased the speed of it. These are the real people behind the product from Southworks, and it's been more than a pleasure to work with people with such level of professionalism, enthusiasm and technical knowledge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks and read you soon!<br>~johnny</p>
