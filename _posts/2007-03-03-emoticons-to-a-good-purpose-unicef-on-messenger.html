<p>As you might now Microsoft released the final version of Windows Live Messenger 8.1. What you might won't know is that this version has hidden emoticons that helps on good purposes each time they're used.</p> <p>The supported organization is <a href="http://www.ninemillion.org">www.ninemillion.org</a> that provides education and the posibility to play sports to the refugees children of the world. </p> <p>Using the following shortcuts you will be able to use the new emoticon and Microsoft will contribute to <a href="http://www.ninemillon.org">www.ninemillon.org</a> each time you start a conversation using that emoticon. The list of short-cuts is the following:</p> <p>*sierra<br>*bgca<br>*9mil<br>*hsus<br>*komen<br>*one<br>*mssoc<br>*care<br>*acs<br>*oxfam<br>*mod<br>*help<br>*red+u<br>*unicef<br>*wwf<br>*naf</p> <p>You just have to include one of those words and you'll have your nickname or personal message with the emoticon mentionated above (you <strong>must include the * too</strong>). That will look like:  <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/146/409014837_ad2529a4dd.jpg?v=0" target="_new"><img height="122" alt="MSN" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/146/409014837_ad2529a4dd.jpg?v=0" width="320" border="0"></a>  <p>Help those kids, there're the future. You know, it doesn't cost you a single cent.  <p>Â   <p>thanks,<br>~johnny</p>
