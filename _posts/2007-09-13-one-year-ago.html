<p>On September 13th of 2006, <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/mariano/">Mariano Szklanny</a> and I traveled for the first time to Redmond. Where we worked on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">Web Client Software Factory</a>, it was an amazing experience from the personal and professional side. I think it was a life-time opportunity, and we took most out of it.</p>  <p>As I did when I came back, thanks to everybody who made this trip possible and those who held us and made us feel like home: <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks Team</a> (specially Alex Jack and <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/matiaswoloski">Mat&#237;as Woloski</a>), Tim Osborn, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/">Eugenio Pace</a>, <a href="http://diegumzone.spaces.live.com/">Diego Dagum</a>,&#160; <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb264518.aspx#wcsfauthorsandcontributors">P&amp;P WCSF Team</a>, and many more.</p>  <p>Here is a summary of memories from our stay</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1369394671/"><img alt="OneYearFromRedmond" src="http://static.flickr.com/1124/1369394671_9e6fb1532f.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p> thanks,   <br />~johnny</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=54"></a></p>
