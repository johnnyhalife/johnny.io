<p>Hi!, I'm currently at Salta, Argentina, this morining I presented LINQ (Lenguage Integrated Query) and C# 3.0&#160; to the students of&#160; <i>Universidad Cat&#243;lica de Salta</i>. The meeting was great about 50 students of the last years. Then at the afternoon I met students that want to create new students group. I've reached 4 new groups: one about Active Directory, one about .net and C# 3.0 , one about Mobile Techonologies and one about ASP.NET. They're the new 25 students in this program. Hope can see the results soon.</p>  <p>Well, in 40 minutes i'll be at the airport. I wanna go home, I'm too tired.</p>  <p></p>  <p>bye    <br />johnny</p>
