<p>Fellows, I'm more than pleased to announce that our first open source project has been published on Google Code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sdctasks/">http://code.google.com/p/sdctasks/</a>. This project is a set of comprehensive MSBuild tasks that we built along with the maturity of our build process.</p>  <p style="text-align: center"><a title="sdc by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2616219518/"><img height="500" alt="sdc" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3063/2616219518_dafa28bc71.jpg" width="449" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>These are that tasks <strong>the conforms our internal build process</strong>. The SDC tasks are a collection of MSBuild tasks that we designed to make our development team life easy. You can use these tasks in your own MSBuild projects, use them standalone or use them as further reference to write your own tasks. </p>  <p>There are 8 tasks included in this library and the number continuously grow , in the v1 there are tasks for: <b>Add copyright headers to your files, run MSTests, generate code coverage reports from your MSTests , run Source Analysis, update your assemblies information, remove duplicated files from a file collection, generate SFX packages, and enable web application code coverage for MSTests. </b></p>  <p>The deliverable is released on Source Code form, we&#8217;re looking forward to provide an installer soon!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>thanks,   <br />~johnny</p>
