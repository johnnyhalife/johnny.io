<p>Finanlly I'm at Salta. I travelled 6 hours (visit Tucum&#225;n) in the route to get my final destination in this trip. The objective of this tour is to get more students involved in the technogly community by creating user groups. I hope I can reach so much groups because this is a unique opportunity to students to be reconized, supported for they group work, and to learn more and more about Technology We can send them the material, the presentations, I can go there to the University to encourage them but all the work must be done by them. One of my favourite samples is GENTI , an IT Group from Santiago del Estero, that made an event (2 days) with 350 assistants. </p>  <p>Well, this is my trip, I hope I can be back at home soon with everyone I love.</p>  <p>Bye.   <br />johnny</p>
