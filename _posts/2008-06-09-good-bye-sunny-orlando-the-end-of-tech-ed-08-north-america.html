<p>Today <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/lito">Lito</a> came from Tech Ed 08' that was held on Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, FL. The stuff shown there was amazing and I had the chance to attend many chat talks and conversations about technology that is something that I personally love.</p>  <p>I haven't been posting since <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/johnny/archive/2008/06/05/Tech-Ed-North-America-2008-from-the-trenches.aspx">Wednesday</a> because things went busy on Tech Ed, here is a brief summary of what happened since then till I got home.</p>  <p><strong>Thursday, preparing the demo.</strong> I got up early in the morning and head out to OCCC to help <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sync">Liam and Moe</a> to setup the demo for their breakout session. They showed the Microsoft Sync Toy vNext that we help to build at Southworks. Then after relaxing a little bit and meet some folks around I had a <em>Ask the experts session </em>with Moe where we discussed things like <em>Sync with Services and Devices (including non-windows based)</em>.<em> </em>The talk was great and after that we went to have a nap since Thursday night was the <em>Attendee Party at Universal Studios</em>. </p>  <p><a title="IMGP3961 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2562835221/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3961" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/2562835221_8093060ca5.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><em>Sync Toy in action live from Liam's and Moe's&#160; (MSFT Sync Framework) presentation.</em></p>  <p><strong>Friday, the day to say good bye.</strong> We went to OCCC in the morning, where people were saying good bye to Tech Ed. I caught up with everybody I saw at Tech Ed to say good bye. After that everything was about shopping, taking Tim and Anthony to the airport and prepare our stuff.</p>  <p><a title="IMGP4000 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2563645216/"><em><img height="375" alt="IMGP4000" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3117/2563645216_4d1a15548c.jpg" width="500" /></em></a><em>      <br />Last picture at the boot. Lito, Tim and me.</em></p>  <p><strong>Saturday, it never ends until it ends.</strong> We were ready to leave to the airport but since we where in Orlando, FL. where the dreams come true,&#160; Lito and I went to have a quick trip around the Disney Hollywood Studios theme park and then yes we went to the airport to come back home.</p>  <p><a title="IMGP4044 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2563675530/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP4044" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3078/2563675530_f05b84b5e3.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><em>That's how a shopping session ends, more if Lito is on his spree </em></p>  <h3><em>Summary</em></h3>  <p>Tech Ed 08' - North America was a great experience from my personal perspective and I guess with Southworks as a whole we had chance to put out some demos we help to built (syncToy, SQL Data Platform Keynote, and so on). As you can see Lito, Tim and I were the visible faces of a whole team working towards a single objective become better every time and be ready to take the opportunities as they show up.</p>  <p>I'd like to thank too much people, the list is endless but here are the one that I can recall of:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Ale Jack and <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/matiaswoloski">Matias</a></strong>, for trusting me and let me be part of this experience and Southworks. </li>    <li><strong><a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ebella">Eze B</a> and <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/sdurandeu">Seba D,</a> </strong>whose extremely hard efforts made the Sync Toy an amazing and attractive piece of software to be displayed, I sure we wouldn't make it for Tech Ed without you help and involvement. <strong>You really hit a homer :)</strong> </li>    <li><strong><a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/jpgarcia">Juan Pablo Garcia</a> and <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ezequielm">Ezequiel Morito</a> (Engineering Excellence), </strong>for demonstrating that excellence is easy, and that you can keep it up no matter what.
