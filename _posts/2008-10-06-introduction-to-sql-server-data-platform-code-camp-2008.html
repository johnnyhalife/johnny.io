	Yesterday, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/pdamiani" target="_blank">Lito</a> &amp; I gave a presentation on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver" target="_blank">SQL Server Data Platform</a> at Code Camp 2008 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm really happy that the conference got really crowded, with people even sitting on the floor. I have really enjoyed what our presentation, and when it was over I got that felling of happiness because I was really satisfied with what we have done.
</p>
<p>
	Briefly for those who didn't attend the presentation, we talk about the how our storage needs is getting bigger and bigger, also who does <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver" target="_blank">SQL Server Platform</a> help us to handle the data across that we have everywhere. One of the major points of our presentation was the <em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver" target="_blank">Sync Framework</a>.</em> We have discussed different scenarios for synchronization including hub-based synchronization and peer-to-peer.

Besides the technical stuff of the presentation Code Camp was an event where I've seen too much friends from the industry that you don't see every day all together at the same place. It was really cool, we had discussions technical discussions around almost everything.
