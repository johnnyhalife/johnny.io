<p>Today I woke up feeling a little bit different, and while having my coffee, I started thinking how long would it be until I write this post, and here it is. Last month, I completed my 6-years mark here at <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a>. Just  before approaching that milestone I started thinking about what's next on my professional career, and <strong>I decided to leave Southworks to join a new venture (a startup here in Buenos Aires, Argentina)</strong>.</p>

<p>I've been very lucky to get to work with such smart people, helping and collaborating on all those conferences and keynotes, travel all over helping solving problems, working on interesting projects (i.e. architecting/building <a href="http://johnny.io/2011/09/15/windows-powershell-web-access-now-available/">Powershell for Web Browsers, now available on Win 8</a>), and getting to know most of the people that I admire (on geek stuff) personally (like <a href="http://johnny.io/2008/06/14/last-one-from-tech-ed-08-north-america/">when I met Bill Gates</a> or Anders Hejlsberg).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a> gave me lots of opportunities that I think I took advantage of, but the most important thing (and what I'll miss the most) is my team. My relationship with my <em>brothers-in-arms</em> goes far beyond a project, it's a friendship that will transcend jobs, but it won't be the same.</p>

<p>By the end of Friday, January 27, 2012 I'll hand over my card key, my keys, passwords, and then experience an exit interview. Leaving more than 25% of my life behind as lovely memories (6 years, and I'm 26 years old).</p>

<p>It's funny that I'm thinking on an exit interview, and that I talk about offices, projects, and trips since when I got here, I used to sit on a stool (literally) and share a couple of cheap tables. I think that what I most enjoyed is being part of the journey of becoming a real-company.</p>

<p>My new adventure is related to an startup in which I'll be giving my best to create an awesome product, and as usual have fun along the way! I think that it's the correct step given my age, and experience.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I’ll let you know (very very soon), when I start a new gig. My new company is an awesome project, and I'd love to hear what you think about it. Also it has good friends that I met throughout the years, and I’m very excited about this new position that will help me do what (<em>I think</em>) I do best <strong>THINK, INVENT, CREATE, and BUILD</strong>.</p>

<h2>And in the end...</h2>
<p>I will really miss working at Southworks and being so-close involved with Microsoft, and its community but I'll really stay around, continue doing, helping and speaking on community-related events. I am really excited about this new opportunity, and I hope you continue reading my blog which will have more startup adventures and lessons learnt that ever!</p>

<p>You will be able to continue reading my stuff on <a href="http://johnny.io">my blog</a> and you can <a href="http://twitter.com">follow me on twitter</a>!</p>

<p>Thanks, and rock on!</p>
