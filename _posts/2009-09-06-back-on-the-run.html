Fellow, after almost eleven months away from bloggin' since <a href="http://twitter.com/johnnyhalife">twitter</a> has taken 100% of my attention (or at least the daily attention I spend for writing). I've been working a lot, on new and different types of projects conquering the cloud and having the joy of learning new programming languages (more to be written soon).

This time, I'm back as I left, hitting the road, but not alone I'll be presenting with great friends about different topics, but with the core in common<strong> *Dynamic Languages*, </strong>you know since I <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/2008/07/20/dynamic-languages-a-software-odyssey-or-just-another-buzz/">wrote my first post about it that dynamism became an obsession for me.</a>

<img class="alignright" style="border: 0px;float: right;margin-left: 10px" src="http://files.me.com/johnny.halife/7txlwv" alt="" width="318" height="89" />First, I'll be having the pleasure of sharing a presentation about<a href="http://ar.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/25/"> "Python running on web-browsers with .NET (on Mac OS)"</a> with the Master Jedi <a href="http://msalias.blogdrive.com/">Martín Salías</a>. We will be talking about how to leverage a lovely language with great potential like <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> on a .NET Managed Environment even with non-windows operating systems. The presentation will be in context of the <strong><a href="http://ar.pycon.org/2009/">PyCon 2009 in Buenos Aires</a>.</strong>

Later on, <a href="http://www.codecamp.com.ar/">it's Code Camp time</a>! This time on the biggest academic event that Microsoft organizes on Argentina, I'll be having two different sessions, about very different topics.

<a href="http://www.codecamp.com.ar/"><img class="alignright" style="float: right" src="http://files.me.com/johnny.halife/p4k5ht" alt="" width="205" height="115" /></a>

The first session on Code Camp will be held one of my best friends and life time geek-partner <a href="http://zpod.com.ar">Zaiden</a> about C#4, .NET 4 and Visual Studio 2010. We will try to cover as much as possible from an overview of the next gen platform up to the caveats of C# 4.0 unveiling the dynamic power hidden on it.

The second and last session I'll be having on Code Camp will be with the great <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/">Matías Woloski</a>, there we will discover the power stored on the cloud, the future on <a href="http://www.google.com.ar/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;oi=video_result&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dae_DKNwK_ms&amp;ei=fOShSsT-F6Wc8QbT-qXTDw&amp;rct=j&amp;q=cloud+computing&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQhCIWAVPEcJyTO-4_Mr0zuYQmDA">Cloud Computing</a> and what is what makes<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure"> Windows Azure </a>the data center where we love to publish our applications.

That's it for this post, but I promise you that I'll be back soon writing about some of the the things I figured out, what we did, and what we discover about Software Architecture and recurrent problems on Software Development.

Remember, I'll see you on the road!
