<p>I'm proud to announce that we have helped Microsoft Architecture Strategy Team shipping another version of LitwareHR. These are (among others) the enhancements done for this new version of LitwareHR:</p>  <p><a title="lwhr_summary" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/2045665310/"><img alt="lwhr_summary" src="http://static.flickr.com/2253/2045665310_e09d83157f.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>&#183; <b>Platform upgrade</b>. Updated LitwareHR v2.0 to run on <i>Windows Sever 2008</i> and <i>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (Beta 2)</i>. This included leveraging new technologies like <i>Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (ADSLDS)</i>, new management APIs and IIS7.</p>  <p>&#183; <b>Performance</b>. We did performance assessment work for Multi Tenant Database design, the outcome of this research is reflected on a new asset called <b><i></i></b><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LitwareHR/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8440">Multi Tenant Database Guide.</a> Based on this assessment we have updated LitwareHR data access code to enhance its performance.</p>  <p>&#183; <b>Services Enhancements. </b>Created new services leveraging Windows Communication Foundation 3.5 features as RSS &amp; REST.</p>  <p>&#183; <b>SilverLight Streaming mash-up. </b>We did a mash-up with LitwareHR and Silverlight Streaming Services that allows candidate evaluation screen to display a video submitted by the applicant.</p>  <p>&#183; <b>Automated Deployment. </b>Moved from the <i>old document&#160; + readme + bunch of scripts</i> approach to a new one including dependency checking and automated configuration.</p>  <p>&#183; <b>Smart Client Application. </b>We included a WPF application that shows how to consume LitwareHR services from an external application. Also shows offline capabilities.</p>  <p><b>Gadget.</b> We extended the UX of Litware up to the candidate desktop with two gadgets: one for Fabrikam and one for Contoso.</p>  <p align="left">So now go and grab the bits:</p>  <p align="left"><a title="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=LitwareHR&amp;ReleaseId=8439" href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=LitwareHR&amp;ReleaseId=8439">http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=LitwareHR&amp;ReleaseId=8439</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>thanks,   <br />~johnny</p>
