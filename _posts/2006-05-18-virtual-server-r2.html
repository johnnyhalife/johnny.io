As I told you , I travelled around the country with Alejandro Ponicke (IT Pro), while we were flying to Santiago del Estero I was loading a Virtual PC, and suddenly he told me : <i>"STOP!Â  start using Virtual Server R2 Enterprise and you'll never come back"</i>. I switched Virtual PC for Virtual Server R2 and the performance was improved in a 100% . Hope this post helps you if you're using WCF-LINQ-WINFX to see how them work and you're using VPC o VMWARE. This tool rocks, you can connect by RDP Connections, you can select the resource allocations.<br><br><br>Download it! Now it's free (via <a href="/blogs/mariano/archive/2006/04/05/339.aspx">Mariano Szklanny</a>)<br><br>bye<br><br>johnny<br>
