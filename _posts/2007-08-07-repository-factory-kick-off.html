<p>Today <a href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/presenterinfo.aspx?id=3e566155-db9a-4a6c-848e-378c924ef986">Chris Tavares</a> and I started working on the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">Repository Factory</a>. This is a guidance package that automates creation of entity classes that map to database tables and repository classes to read and write those entity classes. The generated code removes the tedium task of creating a persistence-ignorant domain model.</p> <p>This package was originally shipped with the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory">Web Service Software Factory</a> as "Data Access Guidance Package". But we saw that Data Access is a much larger problem space than just services. The source code of the current Guidance Package is available on CodePlex website <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory</a>. </p> <p>On CodePlex web site you'll find the list of work items we've identified and also some community added. If you've got a suggestion or want something to be in the Guidance Package, enter <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">our CodePlex site</a> and vote for your favorite work item.</p> <h3>FAQ</h3> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Is this another ORM?<br><strong>A: </strong>No, this package is intended to be a light-weight code generator that automates most of the tasks needed to generate a domain model object and persist them to data base.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Does this project has defined scope and a road map?<br><strong>A: </strong>No, although we have a set of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Planned%20Updates&amp;referringTitle=Home">planned updates</a>, once they're competed where going to release the package to the community to drive and develop. Your welcome to participate, for more info visit <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Contributing%20to%20Repository%20Factory&amp;referringTitle=Home">Contributing Repository Factory</a></p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Do I need the Web Service Factory to use this package?<br><strong>A: </strong>No, you'll be able to generate repositories to whatever type of application you're building.<br><strong><br>Q: </strong>Should I wait to your last release to use it?<br><strong>A: </strong>Definitely no, each time we check-in something new it will be related to an issue/feature/enhancement, so you'll be able to download the code and start using it.<br><br><strong>Q: </strong>Which is the first thing you'll get done?<br><strong>A:</strong>  We're currently working on the package independence and isolation from the Web Service Software Factory.Also the factory generates a bunch of generic classes along with the repository, now they're going to be placed in a separated dll and referenced from the project. The result: a cleaner repository project, and removed the duplication of code when you have more than one repository project.</p> <p>Stay tuned, at the end of each week I'll try to post what are the enhancements we've done.</p> <p>thanks,<br>~johnny</p>
