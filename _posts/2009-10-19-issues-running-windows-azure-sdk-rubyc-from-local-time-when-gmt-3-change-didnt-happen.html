<p>I was working on the Ruby Windows Azure SDK and I started receiving HTTP/1.1 403 errors, I figured out which is the problem so here you can get a simple issue analysis</p>

<h3>Symptom</h3>
<p>While trying to connect to Windows Azure (Storage at least) from Argentina, you get 403 errors even dough the message seems to be formatted correctly.</p>

<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>Argentina was supposed to change the time by adjusting it to DTS (Daylight Time Saving), one day before that happens the Argentinean Government decided not to make that change, generating a lots of implications for computer systems adjusted to DTS. </p>

<p>Since Windows Azure relays on UTC Timestamp for making an assertion on the signature, the current time for GMT -3 isn't what is expected from the server side causing the whole message to fail after the an assertion of the signature.</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>
<p>There's no apparent solution yet, but there are a couple of workarounds in order to properly develop against Windows Azure from a not changed GMT -3 time zone.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Change your time zone to GMT -4</strong>. I switched my computer back to Halifax - Canada that has GMT -4 for an Windows Azure started accepting my requests 
</li>
	<li><strong> Keep your computer with the clock one hour ahead </strong>. Keep the current time zone without tweaking the Date/Time, but remember that you will be out of sync with the country</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Both of the workarounds listed above proved to be successfully working, I will stick with GMT -4 since I guide myself (eating, sleeping, and all that) in my computer clock.</p>

<p>Hope it helps,<br />
