Today I <span style="font-weight: bold">taught</span> LINQ in an open class at Moron University UM. The class was great, students from the 4th year of Computers Engeneering were at class. We talked about <i>"impedance mismatch", ORM (object relational mapping), and others OOP topics.</i> The duration of the class was 3 hours, and most student stay all the class. I've enjoyed this new experience, was different from all the conferences of this month.<br><i>Note to assistants: </i>you can download the slideshow from <a href="/blogs/johnny/linq%20MSDN%20-%20final.ppt">here</a> (note: this slideshow is the same but with slightly different template) and the samples can be downloaded from <a href="/blogs/johnny/samples.zip">here.</a><br><br><br>Well, was a pleasure and thank to everybody who made this possible.<br><br><br><br>bye bye<br><br><br>johnny<br>
