<p>Fellows, we're here live from Tech Ed North America - 2008, things have been busy and seems that they will still this way. Let's do a quick pass over what happened during these two days.</p>  <p><strong>Tuesday.</strong>We left our Holiday Inn Room at 5:00 am., since we helped on development of Data Platform Demo (SQL) for BillG's last keynote we had to be there early. After a bunch of sanity checks of the application we were ready to go. </p>  <p><a title="IMGP3904 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2552311561/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3904" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2552311561_7762f5a964.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><em><strong>Demo back-stage Crew</strong>. <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/lito">Lito</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/zowens">Zack</a> and me ensuring that everything is in place for the keynote.</em></p>  <p>Personally, I missed the keynote since <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/lito">Lito</a> and I were behind the scene with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/zowens">Zack</a> controlling the demo and doing all the checks that needed to be done. The demo actually went great, even Bill's feedback was the demo was he was thankful for doing a demo the highest quality. </p>  <p><a title="teched2008- 046_sm by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2553113140/"><img height="375" alt="teched2008- 046_sm" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/2553113140_d198d14212.jpg" width="500" /></a>&#160; <br /><em><strong>BillG Keynote SQL Demo Team. </strong>Right after the keynote ended.Top: Anthony Carrabino, Dave Campbell (SQL - Tech Fellow), </em><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sync"><em>Moe Khosravy</em></a><em> and Tim.

Finally after the booth duties we went to have a nap and then hang out around Orlando.</p>  <p><a title="IMGP3909 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2552326379/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3909" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3282/2552326379_1dd4c009b5.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><strong><em>During booth duties.</em></strong> It's me giving a presentation about Microsoft Sync Framework over the SQL Server &amp; Sync Framework booth.</p>  <p><a title="IMGP3923 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2553153292/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3923" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2553153292_041dd5f893.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><strong>After keynote dinner. </strong>Moe, Lito and me after the keynote dinner.</p>  <p>If you missed the keynote, you can see it online from <b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/techedonline/">http://www.microsoft.com/techedonline/</a>. BTW, Zack has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/zowens/archive/2008/06/03/teched-2008-developers-data-platform-keynote-demo-architecture.aspx">great post explaining the architectural side</a> from the Trey Research Demo we did for the keynote.</b></p>  <p><strong>Wednesday. </strong>Today was all about the booth during the work hours, I was around Tech Ed a little bit too, but mostly all my time was at booth duties demonstrating the Microsoft Sync Framework - Sync Toy, that was actually fun. After duties I went to BOF (Birds of the Feather) sessions were I attend to <strong><em>DLR and Dynamic Languages </em></strong>and later an interesting discussion about <strong><em>Code Quality and Standards. </em></strong>It was really fun, and some interesting conversations show up during the BOF Talks (Also there were some beers to make a relaxed discussion).</p>  <p><a title="IMGP3949 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2553157664/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3949" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/2553157664_fcb3dc3669.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><em><strong>Booth duties day 2. </strong>Lito and me during showing the Sync Toy. </em></p>  <p><strong>Tomorrow (Thursday). </strong>Tomorrow I'll be around Tech Ed, during the morning and at 5:00 pm. I'll be helping <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sync">Moe Khosravy</a> on the <em>Ask The Expert </em>session for Microsoft Sync Framework. I hope, you can make it, come and clarify all your doubts. Also Liam will be holding a session at 1:00 pm introducing Microsoft Sync Framework.</p>  <p><a title="IMGP3956 by johnny.halife, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnyhalife/2552350605/"><img height="375" alt="IMGP3956" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3030/2552350605_776f1e078f.jpg" width="500" /></a>     <br /><em><strong>My profile. </strong>This is what shows up on the DAT Area introducing the Microsoft SQL Server speakers. I was really shocked when I first saw it.</em></p>  <p>That's all the news live from Tech Ed North America - 2008 , Orlando, Florida.</p>  <p>thanks,    <br />~johnny</p>
