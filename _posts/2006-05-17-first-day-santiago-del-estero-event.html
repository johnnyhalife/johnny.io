<p>Yesterday was the first day here at <i>Santiago del Estero</i><i>, Argentina</i><i>. </i>The objective of the trip was to create new users groups and to visit the existing one GENTI. The presentation was great, I showed the <i>Visual Studio Express Family </i>products, and gave them the startup to build new development user groups. I wasn&#8217;t alone, <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/ponicke/">Alejandro Ponicke</a> was with me. He made an avant premier of Windows Vista that was great. </p>  <p>I really want to thank Augusto Alvarez, Mario &amp; Aldo (GENTI Teachers) and everyone here to make the first day an amazing one. Here are some pictures of what I&#8217;m talking about</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/100-1748.jpg"><img height="338" alt="100_1748" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/100-1748-thumb.jpg" width="450" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Also we&#8217;re interviewed by a local tv channel about the upcoming Windows Vista.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/100-1747.jpg"><img height="338" alt="100_1747" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/100-1747-thumb.jpg" width="450" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Today Alejandro will give a conference called &#8220;<i>Duro de Matar&#8221; (die to hard)</i> and I&#8217;ll be teaching ASP.NET and show them &#8220;How to build fast web applications using Visual Web Developer Express&#8221;.</p>  <p>Come back, tomorrow to see what happened today. (Tomorrow after the conference I&#8217;ll be traveling to <i>Salta</i><i>, Argentina</i><i>)</i></p>  <p>Bye</p>  <p><a href="http://staff.southworks.net/photos/blog_gallery/images/538/original.aspx"></a></p>  <p>Johnny.</p>
