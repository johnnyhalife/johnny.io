<p>These days lot of things are coming around, as I mentioned on the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/DinnerNow/" target="_blank">DinnerNow.net</a> posts, lot of technologies were made available. Some of them in beta phase , and some as final releases.</p> <p>I know, you'll probably say: "Ok, I've downloaded <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/DinnerNow/" target="_blank">DinnerNow.net</a>, installed it, and I've seen those technologies working together but now what?". Ok, here is what can you do: <strong>I'm proud to announce (as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamescon" target="_blank">James Conard</a> did in his weblog) that <em>Windows Server 2008 Developer Training Kit (Beta 3) </em>is now public &amp; available.</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center"><img height="285" src="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/jamescon/WindowsLiveWriter/JustreleasedWindowsServer2008DeveloperTr_13E00/default_page.png" width="421"></p> <h3><strong>What I will find if I download the package?</strong></h3> <p>The kit contains presentations used by <em>Developer &amp; Platform Evangelism </em>(DPE) on their early adoption program for ISV (a.k.a <em>Touchdown</em>). It contains presentations on 15 different topics going from IIS7 to .Net 3.0 including stuff like Virtualization and High Performance Computing. It also includes 7 hands on labs, where <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a> helped the DPE team on the development. Check out <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/gabrielsz/archive/2007/07/18/Windows-Server-2008-_2800_beta-3_2900_-Developer-Training-Kit-released_2100_.aspx" target="_blank">Gabriel's blog</a> to read more about the labs.</p> <h3><strong>What should I do now?</strong></h3> <p>C'mon, the answer is easy... <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B36EE81A-AFF5-4314-95D7-DAD3ACFA8094&amp;displaylang=en">Get the bits now!</a> And don't forget to check <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamescon/archive/2007/07/17/just-released-windows-server-2008-developer-training-kit-beta-3.aspx" target="_blank">James' post</a> about it!</p> <p>Also I want to congratulate to the guys who contribute to this amazing package, like: <a href="http://www.managed-world.com/">Jason Olson</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken/">David Aiken</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/">Matt Winkler</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigelwa/">Nigel Watling</a>, <a href="http://brettblog.com/">Brett Hill</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/volkerw">Volker Will</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/justinjsmith">Justin Smith</a>.</p> <p>That's all folks... and stay tuned.</p> <p>thanks,<br>~johnny</p>
