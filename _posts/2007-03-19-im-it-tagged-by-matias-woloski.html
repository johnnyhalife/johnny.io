<p>I&#39;ve been <a href="http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/006087.html">tagged</a> by <a href="/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2007/03/18/Tagged.aspx">Matías Woloski</a>.</p><p>I like this game - You need to reveal five things about you that most of people don&#39;t know, and tag 5 other folks. </p><p>So here are mine:</p><p>- I&#39;m 21 years old and live in Argentina. I work for <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a> and study at <a href="http://www.cema.edu.ar/">college</a>. :)</p><p>-I&#39;m a big music fan, I used to play guitar in a band for 3 years. The band was called Supernova and we used to play <a href="http://www.oasisinet.com/">brit-pop-oasis</a> kind of music.</p><p>-I&#39;m afraid of the dogs, yeah really I cannot see them even if they&#39;re tied. I don&#39;t know where this fear comes from but I think it started when I was a little child.</p><p>-My first computer was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128">Commodore 128</a>, the only thing that I could do with that machine was playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia">Prince of Persia</a>. Then my grandfather bought me a 368DX and I played a lot and learnt a lot doing small quizes on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qbasic">QBasic</a>. And tweaking config.sys and autoexec.bat to better administer computer&#39;s  memory.</p><p>-Books, books, books. I have a huge library at home, I love reading and it&#39;s something that I learnt when I was 4. From trips to redmond I bought more than 25 books. I don&#39;t read just about computers also Economics and Logic are cool topics for me.</p><p>The extra 5 pictures about me:</p><p><img alt="Johnny@Cavern" height="282" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/425676835_383729bbf1.jpg?v=0" width="376" /></p><p><em>At <strong>The Cavern Club, </strong>old Supernova&#39;s time</em></p><p><img alt="Johnny@Living" height="300" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/156/425676732_3809b8b277.jpg?v=0" width="225" /></p><p><em>At <strong>El Living,</strong></em><strong> </strong><em>that&#39;s the funny place that I love.</em></p><p><img alt="Johnny@Seattle" height="308" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/425676793_c3c7ffbe77.jpg?v=0" width="231" /></p><p><em>At <strong>Space Needle, </strong>Seattle, 2006</em></p><p><img alt="Johnny@Southworks" height="278" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/171/425676821_fc3337c48b.jpg?v=0" width="370" /></p><p><em>At <strong>Southworks, </strong>with Mariano and Diego (who takes care of me when I&#39;m at Redmond).</em></p><p><img alt="Johnny &amp; Jessy" height="500" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/425676860_bed3273e9c.jpg?v=0" width="375" /></p><p><em>At <strong>DF, </strong>that&#39;s Jessy my sister, the picture is from Grandma&#39;s 70&#39;s birthday.</em></p><p>That&#39;s it, I&#39;ll keep taggin&#39; people.
