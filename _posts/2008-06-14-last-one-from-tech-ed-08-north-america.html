Folks, I know I promised to start posting about other things after <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/johnny/archive/2008/06/08/Good-bye-sunny-Orlando-_2D00_-The-end-of-Tech-Ed-08_2700_-North-America.aspx">my last post</a> of Tech Ed but something showed up on my inbox yesterday's morning and I didn't want to miss the chance of sharing this with you.

After the whole keynote revolution, we had time to take one-and-only-one picture with the <strong><em>big boss.</em> </strong>The guy that was announcing his retirement that day, William Henry Gates III a.k.a <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>.

This was one of those childhood dreams that become true at some point of my life and I'm still amazed of thinking that he was there and even better I was there.

No more comments, ladies and gentlemen... <strong>the picture</strong>
