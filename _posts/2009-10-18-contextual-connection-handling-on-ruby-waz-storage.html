<p>Today I was discussing with my friend<a href="http://twitter.com/jpgd"> Juampi Garcia</a> who is writing a nice sample application that leverages the <em><a href="http://github.com/johnnyhalife/waz-storage">waz-storage gem</a></em> and some other interesting things. While we were talking about his application, he asked me for some way of overriding the default connection for performing a bunch of operations as he needed it for his application.</p>

<p>I started thinking and looking around some samples from DataMapper and other ORM frameworks that have the ability to override the current context by calling a method or specifying connection name. I looked deeply into it, but end up thinking that it will be better to have a little stack of connections in order to handle different contexts.</p>

<p>I end up writing a new method to WAZ::Storage::Base that enables you to scope your code to some specific context and once that context is left you get back to the default connection.</p>

<p>Consider the following sample in order to better understand what I did</p>

<pre style="font-size: 12px">
  WAZ::Storage::Base.establish_connection!(:account_name =&gt; 'name', :access_key =&gt; 'key')
  
  # any operation performed here will be on the default context expressed above. e.g.
  container = WAZ::Blobs::Container.find('my-container')

  # So, now let's suppose that I need to perform an operation on another context, 
  # but those are just a few, and very scoped that isn't worth switching the whole
  # context to that. Leveraging the new method, I'll just do:
  WAZ::Storage::Base.establish_connection(:account_name =&gt; 'another', :access_key =&gt; 'key') do
     # any operation that I perform here, will be on this new context. e.g.
     another_container = WAZ::Blobs::Container.find('my-container')
     # Note that the operation above is performing a look-up of the container on another
     # storage account.
  end

  # Now that I've left the block, I'm back to my original context.
</pre>

<p>This new feature has been added to project at <a href="http://github.com/johnnyhalife/waz-storage">github.com/johnnyhalife/waz-storage</a> and the new documentation is also available at <a href="http://waz-storage.heroku.com">waz-storage.heroku.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your gem, in order to have this new feature or just using the bleeding edge by cloning the repository on github (<strong>git://github.com/johnnyhalife/waz-storage.git</strong>)</p>

<h4>Another small change</h4>
<p>If you are (or tried) using <em>waz-storage</em> on Heroku.com without rails, you will realize that some exceptions about 'String.start_with?' being undefined may appear. I've added an snippet to implement this method, on the rails way, when loading the waz gem (if it was previously undefined).</p>

<p>thanks, <br/>
