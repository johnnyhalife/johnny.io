<p></p> <p>Hi I'm currently at Santiago del Estero, an argentinean province were <a href="https://blogs.technet.com/ponicke/default.aspx">Ale Ponicke</a> and I will be doing a couple of conferences about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/default.mspx">Windows Server 2008 (formerly code-named "Longhorn Server"),</a> Windows Vista and Office 2007. I'll be presenting the <a href="http://www.dinnernow.net/">DinnerNow.net</a> sample application.</p> <p><img height="322" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/250/521499583_6e7e6b9841.jpg?v=0" width="427" border="0"></p> <p>I arrived yesterday's afternoon, <a title="Mario's blog" href="http://mariomontalvetti.com.ar">Mario</a> picked me up at the airport, and we had lunch at his house with his family. It was great. Then after lunch I checked-in in my hotel, and then played a soccer match with the local user groups members. We had too much fun.</p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/247/521468428_c1896fc391.jpg?v=0"><img height="316" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/247/521468428_c1896fc391.jpg?v=0" width="421" border="0"></a> </p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/235/521468554_735c89bb6a.jpg?v=0"><img height="319" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/235/521468554_735c89bb6a.jpg?v=0" width="425" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Today's morning, I presented DinnerNow.net in the <a href="http://www.unse.edu.ar">UNSE</a> (Santiago del Estero, National, University). It was great, then Ale Ponicke showed Windows Server 2008, and also the hot new code-name "viridian" to be released after Windows 2008.</p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/521468642_251d2d1e80.jpg?v=0"><img height="321" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/521468642_251d2d1e80.jpg?v=0" width="428" border="0"></a></p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/521499457_06b7e32f99.jpg?v=0"><img height="323" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/521499457_06b7e32f99.jpg?v=0" width="430" border="0"></a>  </p> <p>Once again, this University treated us really great, we appreciate effort while where're here, and also this time I had the chance to see the user groups I've been mentoring since last year.</p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/241/521468732_d656209922.jpg?v=0 atomicselection="><img height="328" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/241/521468732_d656209922.jpg?v=0" width="436" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Also I'm catching up with potencial user groups, one of the things that I really like is the passion invested by this guys, and I'm having the challenge of mentoring an UG completly formed by girls!</p> <p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/194/521499547_38c693ea1c.jpg?v=0"><img height="329" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/194/521499547_38c693ea1c.jpg?v=0" width="438" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Tomorrow morning I'll be presenting DinnerNow at UCSE (Catholic University of Santiago del Estero).</p> <p>See you in the next post,<br>~johnny</p>
