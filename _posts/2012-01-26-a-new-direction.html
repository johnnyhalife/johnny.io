title: A New Direction (a goodbye post...)
type: post
---

<p>The time has come, in fact it was a short week, emotionally loaded, going through all the history of these +6 years here. But it's time to say goodbye. I've been thinking (almost for a month), how this post will look like. Should it be funny or loaded of memories that will make me cry? The only thing that I knew was that saying bye would be really hard.</p>  

<p>After giving it a lot of thinking, I decided to write this small chronology of how was it for me staying at Southworks for these +6 years, since the begining until the end of my jounery. Take a sit, and enjoy with me...</p>

<h3>In the begining...</h3>

<p>It started 2254 days ago, sitting on bar called "SODA" in Puerto Madero, I met this guy called "Ale Jack" who wanted to talk with me about a company he was starting. We sat down, it was a strange interview, eating pizza under a beautiful Sun, his plans, thoughts, and vision got me to sign in to the uncertainty and 2 weeks later I was sitting on MÃ©xico 613, Buenos Aires, Argentina where our old office used to be.</p>

<h3>2006, a breakthrough year...</h3>

<p>It started with a awesome course on Certified Scrum Master, where I met someone I'll be working with on my new adventure, but also where I learnt a lot of useful stuff that I applied on daily basis. I was just 20 years old, dying for lifetime experience that was about to happen.</p>

<p>September 20th, 2006, the day that changed everything. Mariano (who I went to school with and one of the reasons I ended here) and I travelled for 3 months to Microsoft Campus on Redmond, Washington, United States (if you ask my mom she'll swear she saw a flight ticket with Oct 24. as the return date). No doubts this was a life changing experience. </p> 

<p>We joined Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices Development Team for helping develop the Web Client Software Factory (yeah, Software Factories, do ye remember?). It was awesome, a real agile environment, with great people, PMs and Architects to learn from. The opportunity of my life, what I was begging for, happened here, I was that developer I always wanted to be.</p>

<p>It was an important year too, as we met <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/tosborn">Tim Osborn</a>, for Southworks as company it was an awesome incorporation, for me personally was a win! I met one of those guys, the ones that have the proper words, for the proper time. A fountain of wisdom,
and one of the best sources for advice.</p> 

<p>2006 ended as cool as it started, <strong>would you travel on Christmas eve? Well, I did and that's how DinnerNow started...</strong></p>

<h3>2007, if it's an acronym, it's in DinnerNow!</h3>

<p>Have you ever wonder how does it feel travelling at least once a week for months taking two planes (~17 hrs.)? Well, I'm almost an expert and let me tell you, sometimes you can go crazy!.</p>

<p>DinnerNow was the most ambitous project I worked for Microsoft DPE. I remember that I travelled to meet with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jamescon">James Conard</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thedavidaiken">David Aiken</a> for building DinnerNow. When I asked the idea sounded cool, but I was more concerned about the technology and when I asked which products were they using the answer was: <em>"Everything, and if there's something we aren't using let's use it"</em>.</p>

<p>DinnerNow was the first integration sample application I've ever seen (and built). It had everything, from NetFx (which was brand new) up to MMC with WPF (our first experiment with that, and the base for all the future MMCs we built), Linq, ASP.NET Ajax, CardSpace et al.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2007-DinnerNow.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2007-DinnerNow.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>One cool thing that was born there was the Dependency Checker, what you see today on Microsoft Samples for checking dependencies was born on DinnerNow. I remember that was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jamescon">James'</a> idea and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thedavidaiken">David</a> created the first prototype which was a single method called <span style="font-family: monospace">DoStuff()</span>.</p> 

<p>On 2007, we also worked with Eugenio Pace on Northwind Hosting which belive it or not was a really close to what it ended up being Windows Azure. It was our approach to SaaS/Cloud Computing. And I'll always remember those discussions which should be pretty similar to those that Windows Azure Team has today.</p>

<h3>2008, the year of the big events (or the year I met Bill Gates!)</h3>

<p>I think the title of the section is descriptive enough but let me tell you what happened on that awesome year. It started with new projects, I was travelling to M&eacute;xico to meet new customers, doing some new stuff. Meanwhile the team here was cracking some code on the SQL Data Services platform that was borning.<p>

<p>I remember that I was in Campus with a bunch of people from M&eacute;xico that I took there for a Workshop on WPF. And while there I got an email from Tim saying that "we have an opportunity to be on last BillG's Keynote". I was damn excited, we agreed that we needed to show what we were capable of, and for a meeting we had with the people working on that I remember writing a WinMo 6.0 app that uploaded a picture straight to SSDS, it's the <span class="label success" style="font-size: 12px;">WOW! effect</span> we were looking for.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO1.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO1.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>Lito, Tim and I travelled to Orlando, FL to assit the SQL Server Team (in charge of Bill Gates' Keynote). There we met with people like S. Somasegar - Corporate VP from the Developer Division (on the picture above) or D. Campbell - Techincall Fellow (on the picture below). It was an awesome experience, and the team we built with SQL Server Product Group was incredible!</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO2.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO2.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>The day came, the demo was a great success, and then we saw him. He was real, there standing and staring at us, when a "Thank you, good job" was said. Our smile was the biggest ever, and through his secretary he accepted (or asked, I don't remember) to take a picture with us, here it's.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO3.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-ORLANDO3.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<h4>PDC 2008 and Sillicon Valley</h4>

<p>We didn't settle after the success of Tech Ed 08' and went for more, we took part on the Keynotes for PDC 08' where project formerly known as RedDog (now Windows Azure) was presented. I remember we had access to the early bits, and our staging environment was a developer machine. That was my first PDC ever, and was awesome.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-PDC1.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-PDC1.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>I remember that we met Anders Hejlsberg (the father of C#, on the picture above), and this "new corporte VP" some guy known as ScottGu (on the picture below) which was awesome, as he really knew what we has talking about (jQuery and all that by that time).</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-PDC2.png" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-PDC2.png" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>Taking advantage that we were close enough to Palo Alto, we decided to go on a Road Trip with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fedejack">Fede Jack</a> and Ale Jack. We went from LA to SFO, well we (Ale and I) slept while Fede drove from LA to SFO =).</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2008-PA.JPG" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2008-PA.JPG" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<h3>2009, the Engineering Excellence year</h3>

<p>I will always remember 2009 as the Engineering Excellence year, it was the year when created <strong>Wolof</strong> which is Southworks' internal backlog management tool (uff, damn it's hard not to say our or my there). We learnt Ruby, we did awesome stuff, and definitely had fun.</p>  

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2009-CREW.JPG" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2009-CREW.JPG" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>These two people are one of my best friends in the world, much more than what work can do. I've been managing these two guys for almost 4 years, and we rocked. If I ever have to choose a team on the world, I'll definitely choose them.</p>

<p>They have been my family, my friends, and my <em>brothers-in-arms</em> for the past years, we've done everything together partying, going out, discuss, fight, create an awesome product like Wolof, travel to Redmond (with JPG), build a Data Center, tier down a Data Center, move a company to the cloud, and enjoyed an awesome friendship that will last forever.</p>

<p>The saddest part of leaving Southworks is leaving them behind on my daily basis, my crew, the EE Team. Damn I'll miss these two, I couldn't help crying while I was writing this, <strong>they're the best that happened to me here @ Southworks.</strong></p>

<h3>2010, and that's what I called an Architect</h3>

<p>With the impulse from Wolof, we got to work on a completely different project it was a GAME! Yes, my friends from 3Melons asked for help and consulting advice for getting their brand new game Bola! to scale and it was awesome. I learnt tons about architecture, and have a lot of fun (even though it was really stressful). It was also the first time I got to work with my soon to be partners.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2010-POWWA.JPG" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2010-POWWA.JPG" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>After Bola's closure we did some work on OData with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sebarenzi">Seba Renzi</a>, and JPG for <a href="http://twitter.com/lostintangent">Jonathan Carter</a> who by that time was Evangelizing OData on Microsoft DPE.</p>

<p>Then the biggest project of my life appear, we went on designing and implementing the UI for Windows Powershell Web Access. I was really lucky to be part as the architect for that project, and got our mark (with JPG) committed on Windows 8 code-base, that for sure was huge milestone on my career and for Southworks!</p>

<h3>2011, we can do it all...</h3>

<p>Last year was full of cool projects, it started on Las Vegas and LA working on Media-related projects and MIX. I got to travel all over doing bunch of interesting things and meeting people from all over. I got to hang out with my friends in different venues all over the world. We had great time working hanging out with <a href="http://drewby.com">Drew Robbins</a>, <a href="http://haacked.com">Phill Haack</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lostintangent">JC</a> and many other MSFT friends.</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2011-VEGAS1.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2011-VEGAS1.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>It was also my last trip to Microsoft Campus as Southworks employee, I went there with my friend JPG on his first time. We had a blast, and worked really hard on the demos for Tech Ed North America 2011, I think it was FabrikamFiber by that time. I will always remember how <a href="http://drewby.com">Drew Robbins</a> rocked the stage!</p>

<p>I remember that just before I took my cab to the Airport, I had an interview with this "supposed to be good dev", his name was Mauro. He was quiet, and after almost 3 hours talking I decided we should hire him. Man, that was one of the best decisions I made here at Southworks, Mauro is a sharp developer and with JPG we have done all sorts of crazy stuff.</p>

<p>Together we did the Content Installer (the Content Distribution Platform that Microsoft DPE is using for delivering Hands On Labs and Training Kits), the Windows 8 Demo called "Margie's Travels", the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows 8, the Windows Azure Toolkit for Android Devices and we even created an awesome demo that was shown by Wade Wegner for managing Windows Azure using Kinect!</p>

<p><a href="/images/20120126/2011-TEAM.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2011-TEAM.jpg" style="width: 800px;"/></a></p>

<p>I really loved working together with this team, and I'm really proud of what we accomplished. I'll miss the adrenaline of working with these guys for sure!</p>
 
<h3>2012, a leap of faith</h3> 

<p>After all the awesome endeavors I've been part throughout all these years I decided to quit and join a new venture. I'll be joining my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/patojutard">Pato Jutard</a> and the rest of <a href="http://tactivos.com">Tactivos</a> team for building <a href="http://mural.ly">Murally</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Murally is an open canvas to collect, remix and share visual ideas!</strong> If you take a look at the Video below you will understand what I'm talking about, and you will see how cool it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px">I'm happy to join this new venture, it'll be an awesome experience for sure. I really like the team we have, and I think all the experience I made working on all these projects will add up to the final result. If you didn't try it yet, <a href="http://mural.ly">go ahead and request a private beta!</a></p>

<h3>And now it's time to say bye...</h3>

<p>I want to thank Alejandro Jack, for offering me the job in the first place and also for trusting a 19 years old kid for doing all these stuff (that's how old I was at the begining). I want to thank the original team including <a href="http://twitter.com/woloski">Mati Woloski</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/litodam">Lito Damiani</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/albertoortega">Beto Ortega</a>, Shaggy Schapiro, Fede Jack, Tim Osborn, and Mariano Szklanny. These people were the original team that helped me get here, and that I'll always remember with a huge smile!</p>

<p>I also want to thank my team/s or the people I worked with and shared my stay here including but not limited to: <a href="http://twitter.com/jpgd">Juampi Garcia</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ezequielm">Ezequiel Morito</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sebasiaco">Sebas Iacomuzzi</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/diegopoza">Tony Poza</a>, Marce Rodriguez, Seba Durandeu, <a href="http://twitter.com/federicoboerr">Fede Boerr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sebarenzi">Seba Renzi</a>, and many more (please forgive me if I miss someone). While it might not have seemed like much at the time, these people offered me an opportunity of joining a team that changed my life with the kind of permanence and indelibility usually reserved for tragedy or parenthood. I couldn't be more thankful.</p>

<p>And lastly, I'd like to thank everyone making Southworks, our customers and everybody that shared some of this story with me. Software Industry is awesome, I love innovation and excellence, and the people I met throughout all these years are passionate about it, and invested a lot reading me or discussing all those ideas that we implemented, that experience is priceless for me. There is no harsher critic or stronger supporter and that passion will continue to lead to great things.</p>

<p>And that's where I'm going. To discover the next generation again, to make a new adventure on an uncertain world, and see what other opportunities are available. You can follow me on Twitter (@johnnyhalife) to find out more!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin: 5px 0px;"><a href="/images/20120126/2012-BYE.jpg" style="cursor: pointer"><img src="/images/20120126/2012-BYE.jpg" style="heigth: 400px;"/></a></p>

<h3>Thanks, and may the force be with you!</h3>
