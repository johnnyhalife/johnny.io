<p>Today we've released an updated version of <a title="DinnerNow" href="http://www.dinnernow.net">DinnerNow</a>, it's the v1.2. Most of the fixes and improvements that we're delivering in this oportunity are related to setup and configuration.</p> <p>Also we're delivering a couple of new features:</p> <p><strong>Live Service Tracer Viewer. </strong>We've taken the version of the Live Service Trace Viewer (WPF &amp; WCF) that was developed by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vibro">Vittorio Bertucci</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigmcmurtry/archive/2006/09/19/762689.aspx">Craig McMurtry</a> and make it .NET 3.0 RTM compliant. Also we've embedded that functionality into MMC console.</p> <p><strong>Out-Workflow.</strong> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken">David</a> has developed a formatter for <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=79516">PowerShell</a> that is used in our <em><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken/comments/1620716.aspx">CmdLet</a> </em>to display the workflow status in a graphical version of it. It does a preview of the workflow status using a Control that've done like the workflow designer.</p> <p><strong>CardSpace. </strong>We added the support for <em>Custom Claims</em> for the Card Space Sample in out application. Also you can reuse those claims in the check out process to choose the delivery address.</p> <p>For those who still not beign familiar with <a href="http://www.dinnernow.net">DinnerNow.net</a> this is a short description of it.</p> <h5>What's DinnerNow.net?</h5> <p>DinnerNow.net is a Sample Application that shows how you can develop connected application using several new Microsoft Technologies.  <p>DinnerNow is a ficticious market place where you can order food from different vendors to be delivered at home or office. You can choose the type of food you want (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Meal)  <p>The sample uses most of the lastest Microsoft techologies including: IIS7, ASP.NET AJAX Extensions, LINQ, WCF, WPF, WF, Windows PowerShell, Windows Vista Gadgets, .net Compact Framework and so on. <img height="319" alt="Let's Dinnernow" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/142/397306965_628e53d3eb.jpg?v=0" width="426">  <p>C'mon get the bits right now! <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/DinnerNow">http://www.codeplex.com/DinnerNow</a>  <p>For more information please vist the official web site (<a href="http://www.dinnernow.net">http://www.dinnernow.net</a>) and/or team members blogs: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamescon">James Conard</a> &amp; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken">David Aiken</a>.  <p><strong>Do you want to become an architect? </strong>Visit <a href="http://www.skyscrapr.net/blogs/default.aspx">SkyCrapr blogs</a>s, you're a click away from start your path.  <p>thanks <br>~johnny</p>
