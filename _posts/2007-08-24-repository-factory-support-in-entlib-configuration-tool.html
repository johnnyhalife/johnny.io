<p>Reading <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/">David Hayden's blog</a>, I've found that he made a plug-in that allows you to manage <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">Repository Factory</a>Â configuration information in your app.config/web.config file using the Enterprise Library Configuration Tool GUI.</p> <p>You can <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2007/08/23/RepositoryFactoryEnterpriseLibraryConfigurationToolSupport.aspx">read more on the plug-in on his post here</a>.</p> <p>Stay tuned, another update on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">Repository Factory</a> is on its way.</p> <p>thanks,<br>~johnny</p>
