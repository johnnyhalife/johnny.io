<p> Hi! I&#8217;m at the airplane thinking about this four days that I&#8217;ve spent teaching and learning from students of this, my country. What amazing experience, 2 days at Santiago and 1 and a half at Salta. That&#8217;s amazing friends, for those kids this is their first meeting, I&#8217;m so happy. Everywhere I went people treat me great, and I&#8216;ve learnt a lot from those kids. </p>  <p>But sincerely I want to come back home, this post will be published when the plane land. I hope <i>she </i>will be there (Now I&#8217;m hearing <i>Elvis Costello &#8211; She </i>and <i>James Blunt - You&#8217;re beautiful.</i> I want to go to Southworks&#8217; headquarter, sit at my desk and start working normally. This is an amazing experience in my life, considering I&#8217;m only 20 years old, but I really love what I do at Southworks. </p>  <p>This flight is moving like a <i>rollercoaster</i>, now it&#8217;s 09:23 p.m. (GMT -03) , the captain said we will be landing at Buenos Aires at 10:45 p.m (GMT -03). It&#8217;s -45&#176; outside the plane (I don&#8217;t know why they talk about the temperature outside plane we&#8217;re 10.000 f****k meters high).</p>  <p>Resuming I love this work, I want to thank Alejandro Ponicke for being my <i>trip-mate</i> in the first half of the trip and also Augusto Alvarez, Guillermina (from Salta), Mario and Aldo, and all those kids that were at my conference. Was a very exciting experience, luckily I&#8217;ll be back at 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of the year.</p>  <p>Finishing this <i>trip-post </i>I<i> </i>hope everybody can assist (for Argentinean People) to my conference on Friday (May 19<sup>th</sup>) @ Microsoft Argentina where Angel Java Lop&#233;z and me we will talk about LINQ (The next, C# 3.0, and then). Also everyone it&#8217;s invited to the WebCast that Alejandro G. Jack (PDO &#8211; Southworks) , Mariano Szklanny (SSM &#8211; Southworks) and me (PDM &#8211; Southworks) will be presenting <i>Adoption and Extending VSTS/TFS.</i></p>  <p>Well I want to thank everyone starting from my lady, my boss (Alejandro), Microsoft Academic people for letting me live this amazing experience.</p>  <p>Well, I promise this is the last plane post for the next days.</p>  <p>Bye bye </p>  <p>Johnny.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"></p>
