Today, with <a href="http://blog.salias.com.ar">Mart√≠n</a> we presented Iron Python to non-.net users. The event was slightly different from the events that we usually present since was 100% Open Source - Linux Driven Community.

The event went great, we present Iron Python and everything related to it, like Iron Clad and DLR and everything that is related to bringing dynamic languages to statically typed worlds like .NET. We did a brief tour since the Iron Python inception by Jim Hugunin up to Moonlight and DLR/Core CLR running on the browser.

<img class="alignleft" style="float: left" src="http://files.me.com/johnny.halife/b8i2i3" alt="" width="462" height="231" />Then it was demo time, first we showed Try-Python with a Core CLR running on the browser on Mac OS X, then we raise the bet to gestalt running client side scripting code that we usually do Javascript but written in Python and running on the client side.

We showed the CoreCLR running on the browser by using a Silverlight (Moonlight) plug-in that loads the full Core CLR of the .NET Framework in just 4MBs running on the client side.

At the end of the presentation we did something unexpected by opening a Terminal Application on Ubuntu x86 OS and typing <code style="padding: 2px 3px"><span style="font-size: 13px">sudo apt-get install ironpython</span></code> and <strong>voila Iron Python was running on Ubuntu seamlessly.</strong>
