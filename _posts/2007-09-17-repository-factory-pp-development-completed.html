<p align="left">Hi! First of all I want to recognize my fault since the last two weeks I didn't made my <em>weekly-post</em>. I've been very busy completing the remaining stuff from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory">Repository Factory</a>. That mostly includes the rework of the <em>Create Repository recipe.</em></p>  <h3>Now it's a wizard! </h3>  <p align="left">As you might know our core in this factory was the generation of <em>Repositories, </em>Chris figured out that it was too hard to do (as it was designed). So we've converted the addition of operations to the repository from an ugly screen to a wizard.</p>  <h4>Operation detail </h4>  <h4><a title="rf-2007091701" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1395222534/"><img height="350" alt="rf-2007091701" src="http://static.flickr.com/1422/1395222534_a60f378981.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a></h4>  <h4>Improved parameter mapping</h4>  <p><a title="rf-2007091702" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67651183@N00/1394340005/"><img height="406" alt="rf-2007091702" src="http://static.flickr.com/1064/1394340005_3e31d0c890.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a></p>  <h3>Summary</h3>  <p align="left">I'd like to close this post saying thank you. All the improvements done in this project have been <em>community-driven.</em> As I insisted in all the posts about the Repository Factory, the community managed the course of the actions by prioritizing, voting, providing feedback, and reading these posts. Now it's our call to action: <a title="Wanted- Project coordinator and members" href="http://www.codeplex.com/RepositoryFactory/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=15064">Wanted- Project coordinator and members</a>. Yes, now you have the opportunity to be a developer for this factory!.</p>  <p align="left">From my side I want to thank the community members like BennyXNO and <a href="http://www.davidhayden.com/davidhayden/default.aspx">David Hayden</a> whose continuous feedback help us a lot while doing the factory. I'm really happy to work with Chris Tavares who is a great developer and was a great Project Manager.</p>  <p>thanks,   <br />~johnny</p>
