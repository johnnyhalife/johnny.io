<p>Hi guys, I'm proud to announce that today at 7 p.m. <a href="http://www.dinnernow.net/default.aspx">DinnerNow.net</a> got its golden build.</p>  <p><strong>What's DinnerNow.net?</strong></p>  <p>DinnerNow is a sample application that demonstrates all the latest technologies that Microsoft has lunched this FY07. It goes from IIS7 to LINQ, from Powershell to Windows Vista Gadgets. It's a really cool sample application.</p>  <p><strong>What's the difference between DinnerNow and other sample apps?</strong></p>  <p>Well, DinnerNow it's different, it's a shift in the way that Microsoft develops sample apps. We didn't just to show features and technologies we want to make it real. We want an Enterprise Scenario where people are aware of latest technologies but they don't have the SDK Scenario types where everything is cool and you can use the best features of each technology. We've made a switch we want the technology to be a tool, to interact, to be part of the thing instead of being the thing.</p>  <p><strong>What's cool about DinnerNow.net? </strong></p>  <p>It's an endless thing, we shipped v1.0 but tomorrow we'll be working on v2.0. We want you to send feedback, report bugs, collaborate and suggest what can be cool to do. This sample is not something common; if you are a Dev you can see how the code has been done, and all the development tasks. If you're an IT Pro, just check that we're using Powershell, MMC, and a lot of things to monitor and operate the app. DinnerNow.net it's out and it's for everybody!</p>  <p><strong>What you will found when you download it?</strong></p>  <p>DinnerNow.net has been written by really talented people, apart from latest technologies best practices you'll get reusable code that you can use for your own apps. For example you'll see lots of Powershell samples, how to write an IIS7 handler, how to use WCF with MSMQ. Also you'll find our dependency checker, written by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken">David Aiken</a>, which can adds value to whatever you do. How many times you suffer the pain of getting errors on an application because the right components weren't installed, now you'll see how to perform that check. There's a lot of stuff you just have to download it, and start the research :).</p>  <p><strong>The DinnerNow.net Team</strong></p>  <p>I want to write a paragraph special for these guys. Man, it has been one of the greatest projects that I've shared with such talented people. Everybody in the DinnerNow.net Team it's a guru. It's been really team work, and also we were all committed to get it. I really enjoy working on it.&#160; Also I want to thank everybody on the team for being so polite and for letting me contribute as I can. When you work with people that are open to new ideas, it's one of the best things that you can experience.</p>  <p>So you've read all these lines and didn't get the code... Man, what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.dinnernow.net/default.aspx?tabindex=2&amp;tabid=5">Get it now</a>!</p>  <p>Ohh, I forget to say who is on the Dinnernow.net Team</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://iisanswers.com/brettblog/">Brett Hill</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/daiken/">David Aiken</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamescon">James Conard</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mwinkle/">Matt Winkler</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigelwa/">Nigel Watling</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Please feel free to contribute on our codeplex site, reporting bugs, making constructive suggestions and reporting issues. We expect you to be part of it.</p>  <p> This is the funny ship it picture :)</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/dinnernow32.jpg"><img height="367" alt="dinnernow32" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/dinnernow32-thumb.jpg" width="450" border="0" /></a>&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>thanks,    <br />~johnny</p>
