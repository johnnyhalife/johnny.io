<p>Today was our second day at Santiago del Estero, where we&#39;re doing a couple of conferences about latest technologies DinnerNow.net , Windows Server 2008 (formerly code-named "Windows Longohorn Server") and Windows Vista.<br /><br />My conference was about DinnerNow.net, the sample application I&#39;ve been working on last months. Ale Ponicke showed Windows Vista and a couple of cool technologies (Photosynth, Windows Live Maps).</p><p>Also I&#39;d chance to see other local User Groups that are starting up on development topics. I&#39;d a great time with this guys, when I&#39;m back in the future I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see results and great things from them when I&#39;m back again.</p><p>The conference was great, was the last one of this tour at Santiago del Estero. Again I want to say <strong>thank you!, to everyboday who made this trip possible.</strong> Starting with the GENTI &amp; .netSgo user groups and their teachers (Mario and Aldo).</p><p>This has been cool, now it&#39;s time to head back, going home will be great. Before going back I&#39;ll have lunch with people of UCSE (Catholic University of Santiago del Estero) at <em>Rio Hondo</em>.</p><p>Then we will be travelling to Tucumán where Alejandro and I will be taking the airplane to Buenos Aires.</p><p>This has been another amazing experience, we came here to teach about technology but we learnt lot of things about the people here and their lifes. So personally I&#39;m really happy with this kind of experiences.</p><p>see you on the next post,<br />~johnny</p>
