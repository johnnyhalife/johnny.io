Hi guys, how you doing? Today is a national holiday here in Argentina, so I'm a little relaxed. This time I want to share with you a new entry to the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> made by a co-worker Shaggy <a HREF="/blogs/ariel">(Ariel Schapiro)</a>. This term added to wikipedia is "Ball Stopping", check what it is. This term came out of the monthly team meetings at <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks S.R.L.</a><br><br>Check it on wikipedia : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_stopping">Ballstoping</a><br><br>bye<br><br>johnny.-<br>
