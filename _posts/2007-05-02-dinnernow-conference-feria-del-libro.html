<p> </p><p>The last two weeks Mike and I were presenting at <strong>"La Feria del Libro"</strong> one of the DinnerNow labs as a workshop for Teachers and IT People that assisted to the event.</p><h4>About the event</h4><p>Feria del Libro (Book fair) is the most popular intellectual event in Argentina. It lasts almost 4 weeks and 1.200.000 attendees through the event. The central thing is the book, but a huge other things happen around it, the most important for us is education. We had a stand of 200 m2 there, with a lab with 40 PC with latest technology. </p><h4>The experience</h4><p>It was really cool, was my first time in an event like this with different types of attendees on the same track. It&#39;s a massive event, and people were really interested in it. We held the conference with more than 120 attendees for both tracks. I wish we had more PC so more people could get involved but space was limited by our 200m2 of stand.</p><h4>The material</h4><p>For the attendees, the material will be posted on Mike&#39;s blog soon. The main difference between the material that you&#39;ll get from us and the official one at <a href="http://www.dinnernow.net">www.dinnernow.net</a> is the language. Our presentation was in spanish and we&#39;ve translated the material but if you feel comfortable with english don&#39;t wait get the material from here, otherwise visit Mike&#39;s blog for more info.</p><h4>Memories from the fair</h4><p><img alt="johnny speaking the first day" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/211/481278620_509233c434.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="johnny speaking about WCF the second day" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/481278576_e11f91bf04.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="johnny introducing the conference" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/481278592_d095c1d730.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="the crowd" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/481262668_7a0d13e43c.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="sharing thoughts about LINQ" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/481262664_653d0453a7.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="mike demoing LINQ" height="375" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/481262662_947beafa4c.jpg?v=0" width="500" /></p><p><img alt="why Connected Systems?
