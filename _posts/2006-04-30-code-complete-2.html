<span style="font-family: tahoma">   <p>I've been busy so I couldn't write this post early. There's a book that every developer <b>must read;</b> I'm talking about <a href="http://www.cc2e.com/"><i>Code Complete 2</i></a>&#160; written by <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/">Steve McConnell</a>. The book is about making better software starting from the way we code it. It's a new classic and every developer should read it once per year. These are some comments about the book:</p>    <p><i>&quot;Whether you are a new or experienced developer. Code Complete, Second Edition, teaches you the best ways to think about programming.&quot; <a href="http://www.wintellecte.com/">Jeffrey Richter</a>, Author, Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming.</i></p>    <p><i>&quot;The definitive guide to software construction - the one book a programmer packing for a desert island should take.&quot; Diomidis Spinellis, Author, Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective.</i></p>    <p><i>&quot;Steve McConnell is one of those rare souls who practice the state of art and demystify it, too&quot; John Vlissides, IBM Research; Coauthor, Design Patterns.</i></p>    <p><i>&quot;Steve McConnell knows more ab out building software than anyone else; we're lucky he has packed all his insight and practical experience into this important original book&quot;. Alan Cooper, &quot;Father of Visual Basic&quot;; Author, About Face.</i></p>    <p><i>I'll be posting more books I think you should read or books that I've read and enjoyed.</i></p> </span>
