<p>As <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/mariano">Mariano</a> posted we&#8217;re doing a Certified Scrum Master course. Let&#8217;s start this amazing experience from scratch.</p>  <p><b>Day 1</b></p>  <p><b>Tuesday 9:15.</b> I found myself lost @ Chatolic University asking everybody where is the <i>&#8220;Scrum Course&#8221;.</i> Nobodies answered fine, neither close to where the <i>Scrum Certification </i>was taking place. Finally I found a sheet of paper with &#8220;Scrum aqui&#8221; message. Yeah I found it!</p>  <p><b>Tuesday 10:00. </b>The course was like I thought : a guy, speaking in English, in front of the course, with a laptop and a nice power point slideshow. But that&#8217;s the common course structure, but something started to smells when I look at the walls. Every wall was cover with an <strike><a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/old-site/rules.htm">Sprint Backlog</a></strike> <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/taskboard.php"><i>Task Board </i></a>or sheets of brown paper where the trainer started to write in.</p>  <p><b>Tuesday 12:00. </b>After a twenty minutes coffee break course continued as started. Talking about principles, and what&#8217;s agile, why it&#8217;s better than waterfall. And lunch time begun.</p>  <p><b>Tuesday 15:00 to 18:00. </b>Wow! <i>Scrum in-a-box</i> simulation. We started in each table to work as a team to develop <i>Scrum in-a-box (An off-the-shelf scrum training kit)</i>. Stories were vague, nobody knew what to do, we were on the edge of Anarchy (mapping it to <a href="http://www.siliconyogi.com/andreas/it_professional/sol/complexsystems/NotesImages/Topic45NotesImage10.jpg">Stacey Matrix</a>). Teams didn&#8217;t understand requirements but the started spiking. Some team felt like they&#8217;re failing. But when we start sprinting everything was clear.</p>  <p><b>Day 1: </b>We&#8217;ve learnt that you always have to move, to do, to fail early, your risks won&#8217;t go until you move. Spiking is a good technique for start working. A great agile principle (refactoring) was demonstrated.</p>  <p><b>Wednesday 9:00 thru 18:00. </b>Course started different on Wednesday, we started sprinting, our Product Owner started re-writing the stories, etc. Was great, 2 days and were a team, I neither knew some team-mates names but I knew what they were committed on. This day was richer than the first one. We learnt lot of things, like estimating like a team, working in a time-box way, and Agile Stuff like that. This day was a sprint, although we stopped to lunch, and some coffees, it felt like we were working and sprinting like scrums teams does every day.</p>  <p><b>Day 2: </b>I resumed what we learnt on description above, but there was something that really got my attention. <i><a href="http://www.agilethinking.net/">Tobias Mayer</a>, </i>our trainer he is a very agile guy, he does with love, passion and happiness. He started the course like a common trainer but it seemed that he didn&#8217;t like to talk using the notebook. He is a great guy and knows a lot about <i>organizations and teams.</i> He as the teacher has added lot of value to this course. Learn by doing is great!!!!</p>  <p>That&#8217;s all, now I can show my diploma and this cute logo with my name.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/scrumlogo.jpg"><img height="133" alt="scrumlogo" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/jhalife/files/2008/06/scrumlogo-thumb.jpg" width="177" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Thanks to my table team, other teams, Tobias and Alan Cyment (the logistics and organization guy). This is one of the richer experiences of my life.</p>  <p align="left"><b>UPDATE - 2:00 a.m GMT-3: </b>We're the first group of Latin America to achive the scrum master certification.</p>  <p align="left"><b>UPDATE </b><b>- 2:20 a.m GMT-3</b><b>: </b>These are some pictures of this adventure!
