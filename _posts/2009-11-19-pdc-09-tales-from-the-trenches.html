About a month ago, I left my home in Buenos Aires to start working with James Conard and his team on the "Cloud Convergence" Demo and some other PDC 09' Stuff. Today since Ray Ozzie touched the stage we (backstage) were waiting for our demo to become true. Before that were a couple of demos, and specially (and I'll talk about this later on this post) <strong>"Tailspin Travel"</strong>.</p>

<p>When we got to Redmond area, we met<a href="http://www.lostintangent.com"> Jonathan Carter (a.k.a JC)</a> who was working with PC (a fellow southy), they were working on the <a href="http://tailspin.codeplex.com">"Tailspin Travel" </a> demo for the keynote that was shown by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/camerons/">Cameron Skinner</a>. Tailpin's demo represents most of the "best practices" that you should apply when doing an ASP.NET MVC Web Application that has features like back-end support with Workflow and other WCF Services, and integrates with your Enterprise Identity using WS-Federation Protocol.</p>
<p>Imagine how good the demo was, that we took that same application to do our work on the "Future of the Platform".  Additionally, they are doing something great with the application that since the keynote was available for you to <a href="http://tailspintravel.codeplex.com/">download</a> it and learn the "goodies" of .NET 4/WIF/AppFabric development.</p>

<h3>Tailspin Travel</h3>
<p>The Tailspin Travel application covers a pretty substantial set of functionality, but ultimately seeks to provide a holistic perspective of how Visual Studio 2010, .NET Framework 4, and the server platform can be used together. Among other technologies it leverages: Visual Studio 2010 (with the new fancy diagrams), .NET 4.0 (MVC2, WIF, WF, WCF, and so) andshow the hosting layer of your services using the brand-new "AppFabric"
I guess at this point of the post you should be rushing to <a href="http://tailspintravel.codeplex.com/">get the bits</a>, and if you don't go new to get them at http://tailspintravel.codeplex.com/.</p>

<h3>Meet me at PDC</h3>

I'm on PDC with other fellow <a href="http://southworks.net">Southies,</a> we are all the time around, and if you want to talk and share a coffee, just look for me or DM message at <a href="http://twitter.com/johnnyhalife">@johnnyhalife</a> on twitter and we will meet for sure.</p>

<p>Today I've been interviewed by Jean-Christophe Cimetiere about the work I'm doing with Ruby and Azure. You should stay tuned for more information that I'll be announcing soon on these things, like Azure 2009-09-19 support of the API on the Ruby SDK.</p>

<h4>Acknowledments</h4>
<p>Although Mat√≠as , PC and I where backstage, there were lots of Southies that made these PDC events work great, I sincerely appreciate the work all the Southies were doing, and how do they helped us.</p>

<p>hope to see you around,<br/>
